It's a not-so-merry Christmas for the Simpsons. Mr. Burns plans to cut Christmas bonuses, Marge has to spend the family's Christmas savings to erase a tattoo Bart thought would make a great Christmas present, and when Homer learns he won't be getting a Christmas bonus, life in Springfield gets even tighter. So what's a breadwinner to do, except take a second job as a shopping mall Santa?
