Bart purchases a spy camera through a catalog, and Homer goes to a stag party at a local restaurant. The rest of the family goes to the restaurant coincidentally, and Bart snaps a picture of Homer dancing with a belly dancer, Princess Kashmir. Soon, all of Springfield sees the picture, and Marge orders him out of the house. Homer takes Bart to a burlesque show to explain how he shouldn't take advantage of women.
