Homer and Marge get to go to a preview screening of Mel Gibson's latest film, and everyone but Homer loves it. After reading his response card, Mel lands at the Simpsons house and asks them to help make the movie good. They turn the movie into an extremely violent action movie, but the film studio doesn't like it. They chase Mel and Homer after they steal the reel, but they fail - and the movie is hated by the people at its premiere.
