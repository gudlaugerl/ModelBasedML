Homer begins challenging everyone around him to duels after he sees a Zorro film at the Googolplex. Most people back down, until Homer meets an old-fashioned Colonel who takes him up on his dare. Unable to get out of the contest with the Colonel, Homer and his family flee to the country, where they become farmers. Farm life is difficult until Homer creates a new crop called tomaccoâ€”tomatoes crossed with tobacco.
