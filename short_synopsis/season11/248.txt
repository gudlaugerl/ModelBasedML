In the style of VH1 show "Behind the Music", this documentary takes us back to the beginning of the show, which was apparently a fictionalized, staged version of the life of the "real" Simpsons family, as performed by them. We see Homer's shoddily directed 'pilot' episode before Homer becomes addicted to prescription drugs, Marge makes bizarre business investments, and Bart goes to rehab. The show is put on hiatus after the family/actors split up, and Lisa writes a book about her ordeal. A phony awards show manages to reunite the Simpsons.
