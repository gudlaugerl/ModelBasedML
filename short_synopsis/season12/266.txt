Homer's thumb is severed following breakfast and the episode follows three different paths. Homer's day; as he and Marge race to get his thumb reattached, Lisa's day; as she misses the bus and tries to get to school so that she can win the science fair, and Bart's day; as he and Milhouse make use of a shipment of fireworks that Fat Tony has illegally smuggled into the country. In the end their respective paths come together.
