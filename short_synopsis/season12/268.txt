Homer injures himself while playing basketball at the Springfield YMCA, and needs surgery. While recovering at home, he finds he is good at caring for pets and at babysitting the Flanders' children, so much so that he starts a day care center which gets him nominated for a Good Guy award for service to the community. But Bart and Lisa feel neglected through all of this, and are determined to thwart his award campaign.
