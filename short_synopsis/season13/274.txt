A restaurant hypnotist causes Homer to relive a traumatic childhood experience where, upon swimming in a quarry, he found a dead body. That corpse turned out to be Waylon Smithers' fatherÂ Waylon Smithers, Sr., who had disappeared twenty-five years earlier under suspicious circumstances (which was revealed that Smithers, Sr. had saved Springfield by sacrificing himself after a sudden increase of radiation protons and electrons in the one of the power plant's cores, which developed to be a violent substance including radiation). Meanwhile, Marge fancies Chad Sexington, the man who appears on the packaging of Burly paper towels.
