When a fire engulfs Bart's new treehouse, Homer is pinned beneath an ice sculpture. Santa's Little Helper fails to help him and flees instead, leaving Snowball II to rescue him. Homer starts to hate the hound as a result, but has second thoughts when Santa's Little Helper becomes a mascot for Duff afterwards.
