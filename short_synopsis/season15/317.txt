When Bart finds $1000, Lisa is able to convince him to take the family on a vacation to England instead of spending it on himself. Homer, however, ruins the holiday by crashing his rental British Mini Cooper into the Royal Carriage with the Queen inside. He is put on trial and eventually jailed. Meanwhile, Grandpa attempts to search for his English love interest.
