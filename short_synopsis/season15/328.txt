After a trip to a vineyard, Homer and Marge plan to go on a drinking binge together. But, when Homer crashes the car while drunk driving, he frames a passed out Marge as the driver to avoid being arrested (this would have been his third strike). Marge takes the supposed crime seriously and makes a considerable effort to rehabilitate herself.
