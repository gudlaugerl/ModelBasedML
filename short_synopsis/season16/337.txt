A two-year remodeling of the kitchen (which (a) results in nobody, including Maggie, looking any older two years into the future, and (b) doesn't exist in any other episodes) leads Marge to make a dessert for a church event which is so popular that Apu suggests she enter the Ovenfresh Bake-off, but when the other contestants sabotage her entry, she returns the favor by adding an extra ingredient to the other entries - Maggie's ear drops, absolutely unaware that Lisa saw her do it; when Bart finds the Playdude magazines that Marge found, cut out all of the nudes, and threw out, he and Milhouse think they should start behaving like the bachelors in the magazines, including turning the treehouse into a bachelor pad, complete with James Caan.
