When Bart gets a perfect score on a state capitals test (thanks to Mrs. Krabappel leaving a map of the USA on the wall for her class to see), the party Marge throws for him is so lame that Marge thinks that Bart and Lisa feel she is "overmothering" them, so she shares her love with someone else - Nelson - resulting in Marge taking Nelson in (and putting him in with Bart) when Nelson's mother leaves him; Lisa plans to lose weight when she realizes how fat her posterior is - from her family, friends, and mirror.
