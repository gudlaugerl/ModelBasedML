Marge discovers that her high school journalism partner, Chloe (they were the Springfield High version of Woodward and Bernstein), is now a network TV news reporter (while Marge chose to forego college and marry Homer, Chloe broke up with her boyfriend, Barney, to go to journalism school); when Lisa seems more interested in what Chloe has done with her life than what Marge did with hers, she has to sneak out in the back of Chloe's car to attend a U.N. women's conference in Capitol City, only to end up surrounded by lava with Chloe at the base of the erupting Mount Springfield. Can Marge save the day? Is someone out there who can, maybe fly a helicopter to get Chloe out of harm's way? Is this the end of Classic Drunk Barney?
