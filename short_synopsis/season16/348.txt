When Homer is almost killed by the repeatedly closing garage door, Marge insists that he gets health insurance. However, Homer is considered uninsurable. Marge starts saving money by cutting corners, which doesn't work very well when Homer wastes it faster than Marge saves it. Marge insists that she takes charge of the family finances, resulting in Homer using the savings on the down-payment for an RV. Marge has finally undergone too much peer pressure and turns against him, so Homer seeks out some new friends - fellow RV owners, whom he invites to pull into the backyard. However, their problems disappear the next morning; the problem is, just as well as Bart and Lisa, who plan to drive the RV back to the sales lot.
