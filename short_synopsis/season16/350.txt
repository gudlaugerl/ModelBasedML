In the middle of yet another one of their fights, Bart and Lisa stumble into the basement of Professor Frink's house, where he has been expecting them; it seems that he has perfected the science of predicting the future through astrology. He shows them a glimpse of Springfield "Eight years from Tuesday", where Bart and Lisa are getting ready to attend their Senior Prom before graduating together; Lisa is not only graduating at age 16, but has a scholarship to Yale provided by Mr. Burns he started as punishment for cancelling Christmas. One small problem; Bart's girlfriend isn't happy with his plans for their future, but when Bart saves Mr. Burns from a robbery, Burns gives Bart the chance to go to college - by giving him Lisa's scholarship.
