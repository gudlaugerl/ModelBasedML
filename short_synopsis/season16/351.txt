It is raining in Springfield, and Homer'sÂ roof is leaking, so Homer takes the only sensible course of action; he heads off to Moe's Tavern. However, he spoils a surprise party for Lenny, and makes it worse when the barstool he sits on turns to be a cake in the shape of Lenny's favorite seat, so Homer gets tossed out by Moe. Homer ends up at Knockers, where he meets a fellow loner (voiced by Ray Romano), who turns out to be a roofer. However, no one but Homer ever seems to be able to see Ray - not even Bart, who was in the home repair warehouse with the pair - so Marge and Dr. Hibbert have Homer declared insane.
