Lisa sings to the rest of the family to sleep with a rendition of "Mockingbird" (after they are all suffering from the system shock of an all-vegetable meal), which is so good that she plans to enter Krusty's "Li'l Starmaker" competition (with a grand prize of being animated into an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon). However, when another singer (voiced by American Idol's third winner, Fantasia Barrino) sings a much better version of "Mockingbird", Homer quickly pens a song about Springfield which is a hit with the crowd, and Lisa qualifies for the show. With Homer's help (especially in handling with stagehands), Lisa performs in the finals, but when Homer goes one step too far with his stage fathering, she fires him, and he ends up lending his talents to her final competition.
