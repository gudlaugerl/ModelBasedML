Bart, Lisa, and Homer duck into the mall movie theater after Bart and Lisa have a mishap at the new barber and have to avoid the school's camera club. Inside, Homer watches a movie about the end of the world as foretold in the Bible, leading Homer to do a little research and work out that the Apocalypse begins in one week. Nobody listens to him, until he makes a prediction that "the stars will fall to the Earth", which is exactly what happens when a celebrity-filled blimp crashes, and soon Homer has a pack of followers who join him for the end"- and then desert him when the end doesn't happen, and don't listen to him when he discovers a mistake in his calculations (he counted 12 people at the last supper, but forgot to count Jesus, making 13) - especially Moe, who sold his bar to a company that turned it into a sushi restaurant.
