When a new stamp museum is going to open behind the Simpson house, the Simpsons protest its construction to the point where it is moved to the site of the Springfield Cemetery, and the cemetery is moved to behind the Simpson house. Lisa is afraid of the things she sees, and Homer and Marge are afraid that if Lisa keeps sleeping with them, they will go crazy, but while Homer and Marge ask a psychologist for help, Lisa has her own solution: if she can spend the night in the cemetery, she can overcome her fear.
