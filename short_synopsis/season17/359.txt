When Maggie comes down with the chicken pox, Homer actually takes some advice from Flanders and holds a "pox party" so his friends could have their kids infected. After one too many "Marge-aritas", Kirk and Luanne van Houten plan to get back together. However, Milhouse realizes they are too interested in each other and not interested in him, so he tries to break them up by planting a bra in his parents' bedroom. One problem: Luanne discovers that it is Marge's bra, which leads to Homer and Marge breaking up yet again.
