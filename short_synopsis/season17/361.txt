Marge buys a tandem bicycle because she thinks Homer will ride with her, but when she ends up trying to ride it on her own (and failing miserably), Bart chooses to ride with her. When the teahouse they go to (Marge for the tea, Bart for the cakes) closes, Bart turns his treehouse into a teahouse, but when others call him a mama's boy, he suddenly turns on Marge. Meanwhile, Homer buys a dumbbell from a strongman and, after lifting a pinball machine with one arm, Moe gets Homer involved in competitive arm wrestling.
