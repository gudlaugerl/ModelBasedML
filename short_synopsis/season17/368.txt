Springfield Elementary School has a new gym teacher, Coach Krupt, who plays a game called Bombardment, which consists solely of Krupt knocking the students over with dodgeballs. When an errant solid-ice dodgeball which Bart made to get back at Krupt destroys Groundskeeper Willie's shack and leaves him homeless, the Simpsons take Willie in. Lisa plans to make Willie over into a proper gentleman as a project for the school science fair.
