The commissioner of football is in town to finalize the awarding of a new professional football team to Springfield, but when he gets lost and asks for directions at the Simpson house, Grampa ties him up, leading the commissioner to cancel the team. This results in everybody in town hating Abe to the point where he tries assisted suicide, but when that doesn't happen, he chooses to live life to the fullest, starting with being the toreador at the new football-stadium-turned-bullring.
