When a motorist cuts Homer off and he swears revenge on the driver, Marge, Lisa, and Bart tell legends of revenge:
In prerevolutionary France, Homer plots his revenge on Moe after he frames Homer for treason. The geeks develop a glove to inflict punishment on the bullies, but Milhouse has his own enemies list. When young Bart Simpson's parents are murdered in Gotham City, he becomes Bartman in an attempt to locate the killer.
