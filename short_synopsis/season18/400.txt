In the show's 400th episode (both in terms of episodes aired and produced), Homer buys the 1,000,000th ice-cream cone at a local store, and he ends up on Kent Brockman's news program, but when Brockman swears on live TV after coffee is spilled in his lap, he gets fired after Ned Flanders complains and the FCC fines Channel 6 heavily.
