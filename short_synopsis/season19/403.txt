Matt Dillon guest voices as a tow truck driver in nearby Guidopolis who tows Homer's car (while he is searching for some milk for Maggie, who has become a little too clingy to Marge until Marge hires someone who persuades her into letting Maggie become independent) and ends up selling Homer a tow truck, but when Homer tows away a few too many of his friends' cars, they come up with a solution that results in Homer being put out of business...and possibly out of existence.
