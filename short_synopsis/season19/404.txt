Steve Buscemi guest voices as a bank robber who holds Marge hostage during a robbery, only to give himself up when she promises to visit him in prison (since his mother abandoned him at an amusement park when he was a child), but when Marge finds excuses not to talk to him, much less visit him, he escapes and confronts Marge...and makes her take him to the same park.
