E.T., Go Home - Bart discovers Kodos hiding in the Simpsons' backyard, where Kodos tells him and Lisa to get equipment for contacting someone to pick him up, but in reality he is setting Earth up for an invasion.
 Mr. & Mrs. Simpson - Homer and Marge as Mr. and Mrs. Smith, killers for hire.
 Heck House - When Bart, Nelson, Milhouse, and (begrudgingly) Lisa play too many pranks on Halloween, Ned asks for God's help to have the church's "heck house" scare some sense into them, and God obliges...a little too well, as far as the kids are concerned.
