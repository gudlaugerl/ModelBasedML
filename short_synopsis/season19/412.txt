On Valentine's Day, Homer and Marge get stuck in a tunnel of love (thanks to Bart and some gelatin), so they pass the time with love stories of three couples, animated for our enjoyment:
Homer and Marge as Bonnie and Clyde,
Homer and Marge (again) as "Shady and the Vamp"
Nelson and Lisa as Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen.
