A new troublesome student named Donny arrives at Springfield Elementary School, prompting a gleeful Bart to befriend him as his partner in pranks. Meanwhile, Marge wrecks the family car and gets a new luxury vehicle, which Homer grows attached to. The episode is a parody of the movie "The Departed". The theme song of the movie "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" is also played during the episode.
