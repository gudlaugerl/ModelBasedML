The first of the annual Halloween spook-fest. In 'Bad Dream House', the family moves into an old haunted house and are possessed to kill each other, by a mysterious voice. In 'Hungry Are the Damned', the family is abducted by Kang and Kodos (who make their first appearance) and fattened up to the extent that Lisa questions their motive, and does so incorrectly. Her nosiness results in the Simpsons being dropped off at home again. In 'The Raven', a poem by Edgar Allan Poe is recited with Homer and Bart as the characters.
