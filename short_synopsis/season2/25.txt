When the TV malfunctions, Marge and Homer plan to tell their children a story. After refusing to tell the story of how Bart was born (which would later be seen exactly one season later in season 3's "I Married Marge"), they choose to tell the story of how Homer and Marge met in high schoolâ€”and how Marge almost fell in love with a nerd named Artie Ziff.
