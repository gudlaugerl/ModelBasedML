After Homer is punished for brawling on St. Patrick's Day, he meets a bounty hunter, a parody of Dog the Bounty Hunter, when he gets his bail bond. Intrigued, he plans to try his hand at the profession - but is saved by Flanders when it doesn't go quite to plan. Together, they form an unlikely bounty-hunting duo, but when Homer's attitude gets the better of him, Flanders is less than impressed. Meanwhile, Marge unwittingly starts working at an erotic bakery.
