Bart befriends Bashir bin Laden, a Muslim boy who's new at school, and invites the neighbors over for dinner. Unfortunately, Homer's paranoia gets the better of himself and he ends up offending Bashir and his parents. Homer goes over to the bin Laden home to apologize, but his paranoia strikes again when he observes Bashir's father with sticks of TNT and thinks he is going to blow up Springfield Mall. Meanwhile, Lisa gets a Mapple MyPod - and a bill for over 1200 downloaded songs at 99 cents each.
