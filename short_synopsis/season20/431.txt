A national achievement test has Springfield Elementary School in an uproar. Bart and the school's other underachievers are sent on a class trip to Capital City so they don't bring down the school's score, while Lisa, rattled by her score of "only" 96 percent on a practice test, has trouble with the real thing. Meanwhile, Homer forgets to send an insurance payment on time and has to prevent anyone from getting injured in the Simpson house.
