When Mrs. Krabappel confiscates her students' mobile phones, they hatch a plan to get their teacher drunk to get her to "loosen up". When Principal Skinner fires her, she is replaced by a cool new teacher, Zachary Vaughn, who impresses the kids with his love of texting, Facebook and Twitter. Bart has a lingering guilt about getting Edna fired and tries to help her. With the assistance of a self-help book-slash-DVD, she opens her own muffin store - but she still dreams about being a teacher again.
