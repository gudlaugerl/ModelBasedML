When Homer receives a letter from Edna Krabappel saying that Bart is way behind in his studies, he tries to take a hard line with him, but Marge thinks he has too much work, so Bart finds a way to turn their difference of opinion into a full-scale fight, only for it to end up with the pair choosing that they need to worry about themselves more than Bart - at least until Bart discovers that running trains on the old Springfield Subway System is causing the school's structure to crumble.
