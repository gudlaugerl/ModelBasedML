Marge sends Lisa to a performing arts camp where artsy counselors (guest voices Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords) and fellow musically inclined campers (guest voices Lea Michele, Cory Monteith and Amber Riley from Glee) inspire her to embrace her creative side. After she returns to Springfield, Lisa becomes restless with her boring suburban lifestyle and catches the first bus to Sprooklyn in hopes of reconnecting with her inner hipster. Meanwhile, Krusty gets tricked into the International Supreme Court for all the bad deeds he has done.
