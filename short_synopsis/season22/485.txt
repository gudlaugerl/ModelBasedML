While looking for the spare car key in the key drawer (to get to Maggie, who locked herself in the car along with the car keys), the Simpsons find keys that lead them in three directions; Homer has the key to the Duff Brewery, which leads to a joyride in the Duff Blimp; Marge and Maggie find a key to a windup train that makes flatulent noises; Lisa finds a key to a room of "Banned Band Books" which is really a mysterious empty classroom.
