Superintendent Chalmers is convinced into educating Bart about Theodore Roosevelt, which turns out to be successful. Bart invites the bullies to his education stint, and they like it; however, when Nelson gets injured on a unauthorized field trip to locate Teddy Roosevelt's spectacles, Chalmers gets fired. The boys then take over the school, with all of the kids in it, and agree to allow the staff to enter if Chalmers gets his job back.
