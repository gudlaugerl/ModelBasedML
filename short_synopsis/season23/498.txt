Moe's beloved bar rag, loomed as an ornate medieval tapestry, recounts its millennium-spanning life story. The tapestry was woven out of demon wool, so it could tell the future. It went from being a tapestry hung up in a building to a bar rag. And when the rag goes missing, the supposedly friendless Moe realizes that he has more friends than he thought, so Santa's Little Helper gets the rag, and the rag says that it has never felt such love in its entire lifetime.
 Meanwhile, Bart begs Milhouse for forgiveness after a fight ensues between them. Bart will be forgiven only if Milhouse allows a tough man to punch his best friend. Will Bart lose his fame and have to behave the same way as a loser does?
