After everyone in Springfield (except Ned Flanders) decides they've had enough of the Simpsons, the family is officially banished from the town. Moving to a deranged "off the grid" commune, the family embraces a new lifestyle as wild mountain people. Upon learning that the Simpsons actually enjoy their new home, the rest of Springfield decides to move in, too.
