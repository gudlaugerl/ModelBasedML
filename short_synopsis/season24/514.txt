Homer wins a MyPad at the school auction and Steve Mobbs, who is now in heaven, talks to Homer through it. Homer goes into a slump when he breaks the myPad, until Flanders discovers a miracle tree in the Simpsons' back garden. Everyone thought that a sign of hope will be at Evergreen Terrace but only one person, Kent Brockman, does not believe it. He investigates the sign of hope and saw that a person wrote the word hope with maple syrup.
