Homer befriends Terrence (Fred Armisen) and Emily (Carrie Brownstein), new neighbors from Portland. Homer behaves like Terrence because he wants a younger, cooler image. When Bart gets into a fight with Terrence and Emily's son T-Rex (Patton Oswalt), the friendship becomes strained and Terrence, ticked off at the Simpsons, calls his friends from Portland, Oregon, and Springfield is soon filled with "cool" people. Meanwhile, Marge feels uncomfortable around Emily and her friends when they are breastfeeding, as she is feeding Maggie from the bottle.
