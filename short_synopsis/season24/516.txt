When a fire at the retirement home forces Grampa to move home with the Simpsons, Homer throws out his back on moving day and chooses to stay home while recovering. While enjoying his time alone, Homer gets distracted by "Villageville" - a super-addictive tablet game in which he is able to create his own virtual village, but loses the family dog, Santa's Little Helper. When the family finds the dog, Grampa tells a story of Homer's former dog, Bongo.
