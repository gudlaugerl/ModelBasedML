Moe finds a new lease on life when rich venture capitalists take an interest in his homemade whiskey. Then, Grampa injures himself while babysitting Bart, and quickly discovers he prefers being cared for by his grandson than the staff at the nursing home. Also, Lisa takes exception to a "Tupac-at-Coachella"-style hologram of jazz legend Bleeding Gums Murphy and Sonny Rollins (guest-voicing as himself) appears to ask her not to boycott the record label. The episode's title is a parody of (and reference to) the 1983 film, Risky Business.
