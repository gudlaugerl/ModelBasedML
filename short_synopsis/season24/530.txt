Marge stumbles upon a website for married women to arrange affairs (after mistaking it for a website dedicated to cupcakes) and meets a man named Ben (Seth MacFarlane), who falls for Marge after the two bond over a Downton Abbey-esque period drama. Meanwhile, Bart and Homer obtain a small-scale train from the closing Towne Centre at Springfield Glenne shopping center and continue to build up the train.
