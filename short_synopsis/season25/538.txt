After the power plant's nuclear emissions mix with air particulates from the tire fire, which causes snow to fall, Springfield becomes a tourist hotspot as the only town in America with snow for Christmas this year. Marge opens the house to the boarders, once Christmas shopping prices began to increase.
 In the B-Plot Lisa gets her family cheap but thoughtful gifts. However is brought to tears when they all hate their gifts. Later that night she observes Bart burning the book she got him. When she is outraged at him burning a book he counters by saying she knew he hated books. She only got presents she would feel good about herself for buying them rather than getting them gifts they would actually want. Lisa realizes Bart is right and meets him half way by buying him a tablet, preloaded with e-books and apps.
