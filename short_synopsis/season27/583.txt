Bart’s coming of age story, a la “Boyhood”, chronicles his life from six years old to his time as an accomplished young man. Along the way, his tense relationship with Homer, an overly uncaring version of himself, and Lisa, who overshadows him in every way possible, shape Bart more than he realizes[1]
 Bart's life story is told using flashbacks to when he was as young as six and flash-forwards into the future, featuring a series of fights with Homer and experiences of being overshadowed by Lisa.
