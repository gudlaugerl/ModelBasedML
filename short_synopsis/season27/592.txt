Marge takes Lisa on a girls’ weekend touristy trip to Capital City, where they attend a performance of Bad News Bears: The Musical starring Rannells. During a backstage meet-and-greet after the show, Rannells reminds Lisa — who is going through a rough spell with Marge — that she should feel lucky to have such a great mom. Meanwhile, Bart becomes frustrated that everyone expects his pranks, so he bonds with Maggie to trick people.
