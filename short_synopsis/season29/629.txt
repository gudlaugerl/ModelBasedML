Mr. Burns builds a doomsday ark after believing that the end of the world is near when he watches an old Orson Welles show about Nostradamus. Professor Frink comes up with a new way of testing the citizens of Springfield after Burns wants a test to determine who should go on a spacecraft with him. The results shake the Simpson family to their core, as Homer is dismayed to find he has the lowest possible score, while Lisa becomes obsessed with finding out how Ralph scored higher than she did.
