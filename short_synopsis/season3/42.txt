The sequel to the original Treehouse of Horror. In 'The Monkey's Paw' Lisa's nightmare, she dreams that Homer purchases a monkey's paw that grants the family four wishes. In Bart's nightmare, he dreams that he has the power to read minds, and he punishes people if they are not happy - subsequently turning Homer into a jack-in-the-box. In Homer's nightmare, his brain is put into a Frankenstein-style robot.
