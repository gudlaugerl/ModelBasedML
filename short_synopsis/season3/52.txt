Mr. Burns bets $1,000,000 that his softball team can beat a competing plant's softball team. In order to do so, he replaced the regular softball team with professional baseball players. He gives them jobs at the plant so it wouldn't be legitimately cheating. Mr. Burns gets a new security guard (Roger Clemens), a new janitor (Wade Boggs), a lunchroom cashier (Ken Griffey, Jr.), and other new employees like Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Ozzie Smith, Darryl Strawberry, Jos√© Canseco, and Mike Scioscia.
