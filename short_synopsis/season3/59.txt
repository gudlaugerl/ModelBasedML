Homer's half-brother Herb has been living as a bum since losing his car company because of Homer's failure of designing a car. When he gets an idea for an invention that can make him rich again, he goes to Springfield and asks the Simpsons' help to develop it, using award money that Homer received from Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
