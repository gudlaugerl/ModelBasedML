After Homer wrecks both of the family cars in a snowstorm, he purchases a snowplow truck and uses it to start a business as "Mr. Plow," which proves to be surprisingly successful. Things go well for Homer until Barney starts his own snowplow business ("The Plow King"), competing with Homer, and steals all of Homer's customers.
