After ruining a review by Superintendent Chalmers of Springfield Elementary by commandeering on Groundskeeper Willie's tractor while trying to escape from detention by Principal Skinner for the review, Principal Skinner is furious with Bart and expels him, forcing Marge to home school Bart. Meanwhile, everyone in Springfield is excited for Whacking Day, but as the holiday approaches, Lisa condemns it as violent. Whacking Day is a decades-long tradition which calls for the townspeople to beat snakes to death with sticks. Lisa plans to save the snakes with the help of Whacking Day's honorary MC, Barry White, who uses his sonorous bass vocal style to lure the snakes to safety, where no one can whack them.
