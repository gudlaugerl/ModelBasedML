We flashback to 1985, where Homer, Apu, Principal Skinner, and Chief Wiggum (later replaced by Barney) were the hit barbershop quartet known as The Be Sharps, which was an obvious spoof of the Beatles. Former Beatle, George Harrison, guest stars. The name "Barbershop Quartet" is a parody of "The Million Dollar Quartet".
