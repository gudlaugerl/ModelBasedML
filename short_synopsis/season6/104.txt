In a parody of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, after breaking his leg, Bart spends the first several weeks of summer at his bedroom window, spying on the neighbors with a telescope. Bart finds that staying in his room is boring, that is before he thinks of witnessing Ned Flanders murdering Maude. Did such a thing really happen? Will Bart uncover the truth about this?
