Homer and Marge attend a candy convention and hires Ashley Grant to babysit for the kids. After the convention, Homer gives Ashley a ride home. Homer then notices a very rare Gummi candy stuck to the seat of her pants, so he reaches out and grabs it. Homer is accused of sexual harassment, and the entire town and the media are against him until Groundskeeper Willie saves the day by giving proof of Homer's innocence.
