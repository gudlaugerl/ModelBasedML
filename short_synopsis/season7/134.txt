Like many other Treehouse of Horror episodes, it contains three self-contained segments. In "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores", a freak storm brings Springfield's over-sized advertisements and billboards to life and they begin attacking the town. The second segment, "Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace" is a parody of the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" film series, in which Groundskeeper Willie attacks schoolchildren in their sleep. In the third and final segment, "Homer3", Homer finds himself trapped in a three dimensional world. The last segment is the first time that a Simpsons episode featured a segment that was filmed in live action.
