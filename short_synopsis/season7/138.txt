Troy McClure hosts this behind the scenes style show. We start with a brief history, showing some classic Tracey Ullman clips and then Troy goes on to answer viewers' questions about Smithers' sexuality and Homer's stupidity. We then see never-before-seen deleted scenes from various episodes up to this point and we are shown an alternate ending to 'Who Shot Mr. Burns?' where Smithers actually is the culprit.
