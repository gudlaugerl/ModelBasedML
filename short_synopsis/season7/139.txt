Bart is caught attempting to shoplift a video game. He tries to keep his failed "four-finger discount" trip a secret from Homer and Marge, and initially succeeds. But unfortunately, Marge finds out when the family goes to the same store to have the family Christmas photo taken and punishes Bart by banning him from family activities.
