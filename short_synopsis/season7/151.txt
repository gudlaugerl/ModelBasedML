When a bear wanders down Evergreen Terrace, Quimby proposes tax rises to fund a new bear patrol. To distract people, he blames the taxes on illegal immigrants, and calls for the deportation of all illegal immigrants from Springfield. Apu realizes that he will have to be deported, as his visa is expired, and gets a fake ID from Fat Tony. Lisa realizes that he can apply for amnesty, so Apu  takes a test and is allowed to stay in the country.
