 The Simpson family spends a day at Lake Springfield, where Homer soon gets involved in a parasailing accident, crash landing in the bedroom of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's holiday home. He convinces them that he should work for them as a personal assistant, while keeping it a secret that they are in Springfield. Eventually, Homer becomes good friends with the celebrity couple, though he creeps out the visiting Ron Howard and tries unsuccessfully to pitch a script about a "killer robot driving-instructor that travels back in time for some reason" and a talking pie. Eventually Homer's inability to keep a secret leads Baldwin and Basinger to mistrust him, and they end the friendship. In retaliation Homer starts a mobile museum of "Hollywood Jerks" displaying their personal belongings to get back at them. The celebrities discover this while intending to apologize to Homer. A high speed chase ensues between Homer in the mobile museum and the celebrities in their Hummer H1. Homer agrees to stop after Ron Howard is injured during the chase. Ultimately Homer is court-ordered to keep 500 miles away from any celebrity (living or dead) while Ron Howard successfully pitches Homer's script to Brian Grazer at 20th Century Fox.
