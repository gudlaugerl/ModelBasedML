  Homer and Bart fix things around the house using fireworks. They destroy Lisa's room on her birthday, so to help make it up to her, the family goes to a book fair, where Krusty is signing his new book. A little girl named Sophie is in line and she tells Krusty that she is his daughter. Krusty flashes back to his experiences during the Gulf War, where Krusty had meet Erin after trying to his tent during a sandstorm and accidentally stumbles into Erin's tent and the two make love. However, the next Erin suddenly realises that she is late for her mission to assassinate Saddam Hussein. At the moment when Erin is about to shoot Krusty up to her and prevented her from firing as Erin could kill Saddam because he was half of Krusty act.
 Sophie's mother now hates Krusty, ever since he ruined her mission. Krusty tries spending time with Sophie at the beach, but they don't bond very well. He sees Homer interacting with his kids and gets some parenting advice from him.
 Krusty gambles away Sophie's violin, which is something that means a lot to her, in a poker game with Fat Tony. She gets offended with Krusty, so he, along with Homer's help, tries to gain possession the violin. There is a big mafia summit at Fat Tony's place and Krusty manages to escape with the violin and a bunch of cash (although it was implied that he didn't even know that there was money in the real violin case when he took it), although not without inadvertently starting a gun fight amongst the various mafia members when they dropped most of the other cases (which contained Tommy guns) and had the contents discharge ammo. He wins back Sophie's love. Then Frankie the Squealer, Legs and Louie chase Homer for his role in the caper (and presumably for his role in tearing down their summit) by shooting at him, but Homer outruns them nevertheless.
