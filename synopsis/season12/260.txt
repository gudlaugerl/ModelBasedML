 The Springfield Retirement Castle holds a talent show, which the Simpsons attend. Grampa wins the show after signing a bad version of "What's New, Pussycat?". His prize is a free autopsy, so the Simpsons go to a funeral salesman. While there, Homer realizes that a certain kind of cemetery monument uses the same amount of cement as a tennis court, and so Homer decides to get the house a tennis court, even though Homer mistook tennis for foxy boxing and, as it is, the family can hardly afford their own house. The court is very popular with the residents, who also insulting Homer and Marge for losing all the time due to Homer's absent-mindedness. Marge pleads with Homer to take the games seriously; however, Homer is too oblivious to see how bad he is in tennis. Homer tries to please Marge by entering Krusty's celebrity tournament, the "Krusty Kharity Klassic". Homer is a hopeless tennis player, so Marge "dumps" him and enters with Bart as her new partner. Homer is outraged that he was abandoned for his ten year old son. He has a nightmare where Bart and Marge are married and he is a wall trophy, after being shot at a guillotine factory. Homer enters the tournament with Lisa as his partner. The tournament takes place and in the stands are leading tennis pros Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Venus and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer dumps Lisa for Venus. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, respectively. This forces the family to go back to the bench and resume their normal places in the family; as they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things rather than to do things. Homer offers to buy the family dinner (with money he took from Pete Sampras' wallet).
