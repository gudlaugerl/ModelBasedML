  When the popular game show Me Wantee! steals ratings from The Krusty the Clown Show, Krusty, annoyed with the network executives who refuse to stop pestering him even when on air, announces his fifthâ€”and-final retirement. During an interview with Kent Brockman, Krusty says that he is tired of doing his show, and admits to taping Judge Judy over all his old shows featuring Sideshow Bob. Unfortunately, Bob is one of those who watches as Krusty makes his confession.
 Springfield Elementary Skinner Krusty Burger Cletus Chief Wiggum Bart is sent to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob and driving him to a life of crime. Bob decides not to go through with the plan, but does not have time to stop Bart from taking to the stage. Luckily, Mr. Teeny, Krusty's trained chimp, seizes the life-threatening explosives, and throws them into the network executives' office (the executives are blown up, but reform ala T-1000).
 Bart comes out of his hypnotic trance for good, and he and his family have dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, Bob is sentenced to death by guillotine; however this execution is cancelled after he tells Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for what he did.
