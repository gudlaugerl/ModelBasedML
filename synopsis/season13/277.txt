  The family goes to the library's used book sale, where Marge manages to entice the normally book-hating Homer into buying a copy of Duff's Book of World Records. When Homer goes through all of the records, he plans to set one of his own. Duff tells him that all the personal records have been set, and that he needs to help set a group record. Homer then persuades the town to try to set a record for the world's tallest human pyramid, and with Maggie's help, the world's tallest human pyramid is set. However, everyone has to stay put for "three Mississippis" for the record to count. After two Mississippis pass, Jimbo and Kearney’s hands touch, and they pull them back in revulsion causing the entire town of people to collapse and form a giant ball. The ball rolls down a steep hill (inadvertently saving a man trying to commit suicide and running over both Agnes Skinner and Hans Moleman), landing on a truck depot scale, where the officials, after doing some calculation (based on the number of people, subtracting belts and shoes), declare Springfield the world’s fattest town.
