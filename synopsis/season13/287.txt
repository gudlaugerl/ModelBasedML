  At Springfield Elementary School, Kirk Van Houten holds an unsuccessful short speech about his occupation of being an assistant flyer distributor. Principal Skinner becomes disappointed about not being to find any good speakers for their assemblies about the importance of studying. In his office, Lisa points out the reason that none of the students are following the "buckle down and study" protocol is because the faculty is letting anyone speak, using Kirk Van Houten, Groundskeeper Willie and his enemy, Groundskeeper Seamus, as prime examples since their encouragement is poor. She suggests that they head to the Hall of Motivational Speakers to find someone who can motivate the students at Springfield Elementary to study more.
 There, Lisa suggests they bring in cartoonist Geoff Jenkins, the creator of a cartoon named "Danger Dog" to motivate them. At the next assembly, Geoff tells the kids how easy and rewarding his job is and that he didn't even need to work hard in school to get it, and all he does is "eat candy and watch R-rated movies". This infuriates Skinner because he isn't encouraging the students to follow the "buckle down and study" protocol and pulls the fire alarm in an attempt to distract them. Once they are out of the auditorium, he confronts Jenkins for his behavior and promptly kicks him out. Jenkins' speech prompt all the students to start stop paying attention in class and try to become cartoonists.
