  Homer The Rolling Stones Rock N' Roll Fantasy Camp Otto Lenny Carl The Rolling Stones Squeaky-Voiced Teen However, Homer believes that he will be performing with them and is disappointed when he discovers he was just there to test the microphone. Homer then breaks free from his testing duties, noticing how the crowd (especially his friends) were eager for him to perform, and starts playing guitar and singing. The Rolling Stones (plus the other Rock'n Roll Camp musicians, who were to guest in the show) quickly get frustrated that Homer is stealing their show so they try to stop him by chasing him on-stage in a car shaped like a devil's head that spews fire. It ends terribly when their car flips over into the audience and catches on fire.
 To apologize, they invite him to play with them on their next gig but Homer kindly declines the offer, as he already has a band of his own: his family. They give him a "Guitar Hero" jacket and the devil's head as something to remember them by, and Homer uses it to drop Bart off at school in the bus zone and burn the suit off Principal Skinner.
