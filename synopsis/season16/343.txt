  The Simpsons go to Springfield Park and find it run down. They also find a charity carnival which is raising money to help the park. Bart wins first prize and then Homer beats him, going into his victory dance. Ned captures the dance and Comic Book Guy (revealing that his real name is Jeffrey "Jeff" Albertson) places it on his eBaum's World-esque website. Soon, the entire world has seen Homer's embarrassing dance.
 However, major sports players ask Homer to teach them his dance. Meanwhile, Ned uses his camera to make a movie about Cain (Rod) and Abel (Todd). Everyone loves the film, except Marge, who found it to be way too bloody and horrific--Lisa comes to Ned's defense by pointing out to Marge that he was probably just trying to stay true to the Bible, which (when you really get down it) is actually quite violent. Mr. Burns chooses to finance Ned's next film, "Tales of the Old Testament" (which has a running time of 800 minutes--over thirteen hours--making it the third longest movie in the world). The bloodiness of the film angers Marge and she plans to protest Burns. In this matter, Burns retorts, asking (in what is meant to be a rhetorical fashion) what they would use instead of his nuclear power. When everyone else mentions alternate forms of power they can use (such as solar and hydroelectric), Burns admits defeat and mentions that the film will never be seen again.
 Homer's advices have found criticism, but the football national committee loves them, as they have raised ratings. They ask Homer to choreograph the halftime show for the Super Bowl (which takes place at Capital City Stadium). He can't get any ideas and runs into Ned at church. Homer then gets an idea for the halftime show, which ends up being about Noah. This is hated and the crowd thinks they are trying to desecularize the country.
 Despite the outcome, the family and the sports players celebrate with omelets made from eggs thrown by the outraged crowd.
