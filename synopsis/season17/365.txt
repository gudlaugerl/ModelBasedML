  
When Reverend Lovejoy can't attend the Christmas sermon due to his train set catching on fire, Flanders immediately takes over. However, he gets a paper cut and faints. Homer plans to lead the sermon and tells the story of the first Christmas, with Marge as Mary, Homer as Joseph, Angel Lisa asÂ Gabriel, Mr. Burns as King Herod, and Bart as Jesus.
 Mary tells Joseph that she is pregnant, even though Mary is a virgin. The angel Gabriel appears to them and explains that Mary is going to give birth to the Son of God. The three wise men (Dr. Hibbert as Melchior, Principal Skinner as Caspar, and Professor Frink as Balthazar) tell King Herod that they are going to give gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the King of the Jews. When Herod thinks that the gifts are for him, the men explain to him that they are for the baby Jesus. Herod becomes furious and claims that he will kill the baby.
 Later, when Jesus keeps crying, Mary gives him a wooden pacifier to suck on, so Jesus sucks on it, spits it out and stops crying. Mary gives him to Joseph, who entertains Jesus by hurting himself and Skinner, a la "The Three Stooges". When Jesus finally falls asleep, Herod and his troops find the manger that they're staying in. They escape and trick the soldiers by putting Jesus' halo on a duck. On top of the hill, Joseph cuts down a pine tree, and as it rolls down, the soldier gets caught in it. The soldiers, along with Herod, are arranged like ornaments on the tree, and the duck, still wearing the halo, stands on top of the tree. Mary calls it a Christmas tree, and Homer concludes his service.
