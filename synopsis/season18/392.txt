  Marge oversleeps, and not having made Bart and Lisa lunches for the day, Homer makes them instead. He gives them inedible food and Bart plans to scare an alternative lunch out of his friends by making up a story about a cannibal cafeteria worker named Dark Stanley, who killed all the students in the cafeteria and put them in his stew when their teasing of his inability to graduate from college had taken its toll on him. At lunchtime, Bart pretends to be killed by Dark Stanley with pasta on his head acting as a brain and pasta sauce as blood, causing all of the students to run screaming into the woods while he eats their lunches. Groundskeeper Willie is sent to fetch them all back, but he brings seven extra kids who are Cletus' children. Their names are Whitney, Jitney, Dubya, Incest, Crystal Meth, International Harvester, and Birthday. Principal Skinner tells Superintendent Chalmers that the kids have been refused education, which Lisa overhears. To appease Lisa, Skinner and Chalmers appoint her tutor of the kids.
 counlseor Homer Dr. Stacey Swanson Mad Libs video games Milhouse Marge Lisa's initial tutoring efforts are unsuccessful and so she plans to take the Spuckler kids to downtown Springfield to introduce them to culture in the outside world. However, Lisa's plans are diverted when Krusty observes the kids singing, plans to use them as a musical act for his show, and offers them a contract, which Cletus signs with an "X". Lisa is worried about the way that Krusty and Cletus are exploiting the children, so she sends an e-mail to Brandine Spuckler, who is currently a soldier in Iraq. She arrives by helicopter to tell Krusty that the contract Cletus signed is null and void, since he is only the father of the two untalented ones, and that he signed the contract with an X mark rather than a real signature. The episode finishes with Cletus telling Brandine that they owe Krusty $12,000, but Brandine tells him they can live off that.
