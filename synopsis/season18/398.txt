  Homer, excited about going to Oktoberfest, is disappointed when he discovers that Marge has tricked him and the kids into going to a Harvest Festival, which bans alcohol. While attempting to leave, Homer accidentally leads the family into a cornfield maze. Lisa crafts an escape plan with Tremaux's Algorithm, a real life maze-solving method, but Homer is left behind. Santa's Little Helper is called upon by Bart to find Homer. Santa's Little Helper manages to locate and drag Homer out of the maze. Santaâ€™s Little Helper becomes a hero and the Simpsons, persuaded by Chief Wiggum, enroll him in the Springfield Animal Police Academy, then gets teamed with Lou.
 In the park, Santa's Little Helper catches Snake Jailbird selling drugs to the bullies. Snake is taken to court, but liberated on a technicality. This makes Santa's Little Helper jaded, and when he returns home, he bites Bart. The Simpsons send the pet to live with Lou.
 As a replacement, Marge buys Bart a huge pet python, which he names "Strangles". Bart takes Strangles to show and tell at school, where Strangles escapes into the school lab and unintentionally knocks over jugs filled with chemicals, creating a toxic cloud. Bart collapses inside the building.
 Santa's Little Helper and Strangles arrive to rescue Bart, who chooses his faithful dog to save him. Santa's Little Helper goes back to living with the Simpsons. Strangles becomes adopted by Groundskeeper Willie, who places him in the fire hose coil.
