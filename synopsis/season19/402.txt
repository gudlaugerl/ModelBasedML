  The episode starts with the family escaping from church. Marge announces that she wants to eat out instead of cooking as usual. After finding out every place has lines, the family goes as far as to break into someone's apparent party. It does not take long for them to realize that they actually crashed a funeral ceremony. Homer volunteers to be a pallbearer. After falling into an open grave, Homer is taken to the hospital.
 While at the hospital, Homer finds out his usual "D'oh!" does not sound as normal. While causing the bed to sit upright and lay flat, Dr. Hibbert notices Homer's diaphragm is safely under his stomach when he is lying down, giving him the ability to sing in an operatic voice that causes newborn babies to cease crying and weak patients to feel strong.
