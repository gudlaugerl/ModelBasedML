  The Simpsons' unintelligent dog, Santa's Little Helper, has been causing the family all sorts of problems. He doesn't obey commands, and is just constantly making a nuisance of himself.
 Lisa has the mumps and has to spend a few days home from school. While Marge teaches her sewing, Homer goes to the mall to buy some magazines for her. There he sees and purchases some expensive shoes known as 'Assassins', which he saw Ned Flanders with earlier, and which Santa's Little Helper eventually destroys. Homer eventually goes to the mall's cookie shop to receive a macadamia nut cookie as well.
 Marge shows Lisa a patchwork quilt which is a family heirloom. Lisa makes her own contribution to it, but then Santa's Little Helper rips it up, and Homer's cookie gets eaten.
With all this done, Homer and Marge consider giving the dog away, but the kids have grown to love the dog and protest to keep him, before their parents reluctantly agree that they can keep the pooch if he passes obedience school.
 Santa's Little Helper does not do well at the Obedience School as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain. The night before the final exam, Homer threatens that if Santa's Little Helper fails the exam, he will have to go, but Bart and Lisa are very upset about this and ask to give the dog another chance. Bart and Santa's Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allows Santa's Little Helper to understand Bart's commands, and to pass obedience school much to the family (bar Homer)'s happiness. Lisa marks the occasion by creating a new quilt to replace the one that was destroyed.
