  Mr. Burns wins a basketball franchise the Austin Celtics (which he renames the Springfield Excitement) in a poker game from the Rich Texan at Billionaire Camp. However, he fails to keep the spectators after an incident where he, under the mistaken belief that the mascot of the team was a live gorilla instead of a man dressed as one, shot the mascot and killed him. Meanwhile, Lisa discovers that bees all over the world are dying of bee measles ("beesles"). Lisa starts a colony of healthy bees, and gets a sanctuary for them. However, Mr. Burns builds a basketball stadium on the reserve. Homer then rebuilds a new bee colony from African bees. However, the new bees are attracted to the stadium, which looks like a beehive. Burns opens the stadium's retractable roof, causing the bees to enter the arena and attack everyone inside. In the last scene, Burns returns to Billionaire Camp, but learns he is four million dollars short of a billion dollars, so he is kicked out and sent to the Millionaires' camp.
