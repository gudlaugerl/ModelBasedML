  To Lisa's surprise,  Bart Otto Nelson Ralph Kearney Dolph Jimbo Capital City Principal Skinner Superintendent Chalmers On route, Ralph stops for a bathroom break, and the bus is disassembled by a vandal (while Otto is still on it). The group attempts to walk the rest of the way, but they lose Ralph on a garbage barge.
 NOOO! Mr. Burns Skinner signals for a piano cargo ship to rescue Ralph with its crane, but he accidentally stuns the operator. Skinner rescues Ralph himself by jumping on board the crate hoisted by the crane and using the law of conservation of angular momentum. He lands on the barge and the kids and Otto follow him. As it turns out, the garbage barge they have landed on is headed towards Springfield Elementary.The boys now believe that education is impressive due to Skinner saving the day, and so Skinner reads The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the boys until they arrive, which they enjoy.
