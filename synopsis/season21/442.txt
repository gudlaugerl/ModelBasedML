 Bart and Milhouse convinced Comic Book Guy into publishing a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character, an overweight average man called Avery Mann, can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic books he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer would be perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man like his character. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so that people will see the everyman they 'want' to be rather than the everyman they are. They hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to make Homer fit for the role. After a month, Homer becomes fit and muscular, so the movie begins production. Soon afterwards, however, McCarthy leaves Homer for another client. Without McCarthy to keep him fit, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio executives and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to make Homer physically fit again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to permit Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that he will give false information to the fans and say that he liked the film. However, Comic Book Guy rejects the offer and openly criticizes the movie online by saying, "Worst. Movie. Ever."
