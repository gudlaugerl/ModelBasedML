  Bart and Milhouse convinced Comic Book Guy into publishing a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character, an overweight average man called Avery Mann, can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic books he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer would be perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man like his character. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so that people will see the everyman they 'want' to be rather than the everyman they are. They hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to make Homer fit for the role. After a month, Homer becomes fit and muscular, so the movie begins production.
