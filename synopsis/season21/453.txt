  It is a date night for Homer and Marge but the employees of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant are forced to stay behind and clean up a radioactive leak. This leaves Marge annoyed at Homer for being late. Homer then takes Marge to a movie but are unable to enjoy it because of too much noise and so go ice-skating instead. Marge and Homer wind up at a curling rink when their plans for a date night fall through. They both discover their innate talent for the sport - particularly Marge, who has years of experience sweeping floors. Agnes and Seymour Skinner invite Marge and Homer to join their team, replacing Sarah and Clancy Wiggum. Agnes, however, cautions Marge not to let emotions get in the way of winning, relating how a fetal kick by an unborn Seymour foiled her chances at winning gold in pole vault at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Nevertheless, the Simpson-Skinner team qualifies to compete in the demonstration sport of mixed-doubles curling at the 2010 Winter Olympics.
 Lisa Bart Fatov When they arrive in Vancouver they encounter the Medicine Woman from The Simpsons Movie (who Homer says goodbye to forever). After the Ghostbusters opening ceremony (which was very tiring for the announcer) and a few games, Marge is told by Agnes that she wants Homer off the team. Marge insists she can compensate for his weak throws, but injures her right shoulder while sweeping rigorously to restart Homer's stone. She is told that she will never curl again and that the American curling team must concede defeat to Sweden. After Marge reveals a big secret that she is left-handed, she used her right hand so people wouldn't think of her differently, and by sweeping with her left arm, leads her team to victory and the gold medal, the first and only medal won by the USA in the Olympics. In the end, Homer accidentally cheers with Swedish flag, but changes the flag to American instead.
