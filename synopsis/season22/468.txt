  While Bart and Homer are carving pumpkins and Bart slices a smile into the seat of Homer's pants, Homer chokes him, so Bart puts a flaming pumpkin on his head. Professor Frink then introduces the show, giving a warning about the content and telling those concerned to skip forward. He skips forward too far and says that he has ruined the show for everyone. Frink then points the remote at himself until he passes away and disintegrates into a pile of dust which blows away to reveal "Treehouse of Horror XXI". The monster who was created by Frink picks up the remote and mentions The Office, where he remembers his days working at "Monster Mifflin" with the Mummy, the Wolf Man, a zombie, and a witch. This leads to a parody of the opening, set in the monsters' workplace.
 In a parody of Jumanji, Marge, is worried about Bart playing violent video games, encourages him and Milhouse to play the boardgames in the attic. They discover a game called Satan's Path and play it, causing all the board games to come to life in a different reality. They have to complete the games to win, which results in a game of Mouse Catch.
 Later, Bart chooses to only play hangman (thinking it would be safer). Then it is shown that Bart and Milhouse have been hung.
