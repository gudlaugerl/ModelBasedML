 After Thanksgiving dinner, Marge announces it is time to take the annual Christmas card family photo. When Bart and Lisa complain about the pointlessness of the photos, Marge tells them they will one day grow to appreciate the photos. We then witness a sequence of the the Simpsons' Family Christmas photos from the next 30 years. The sequence shows considerable changes, including Lisa being bisexual and having relationships with three different women while she is attending a private college, and Milhouse Van Houten, whom she marries and has a daughter with. Maggie realizes her talent for music and becomes a famous rock star, acting as the lead singer in her band, and Bart, who flunked out of state college, is left at home until he gets evicted by Homer and Marge at 34 years of age. Homer and Marge are then seen enjoying Christmases alone together. Then, three separate photos of each of the children and their current lives are shown. Lisa is 38, appears to be a successful business woman, and is shown with her teenage daughter Zia and her husband Milhouse, now 40, Maggie is 31 and is shown performing with her formed band at a Christmas themed concert, and Bart and Jenda are 40 and now divorced, and are shown with their two sons, Jiff and Skippy.
