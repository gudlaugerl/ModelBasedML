  On her way to a concert, Lady Gaga passes through Springfield and sees how low the town's self-esteem is. One of the residents who account for the low self-esteem is Lisa, who finds out that her fellow students voted her the most unpopular student. She attempts to become popular by ghostwriting nice things about herself on a school blog titled "Truth Teller."
 Bart, however, gets word of this and tells the entire school, and this makes Lisa's social status drop even further. Lady Gaga is alerted via a psychic force about Lisa's depression, and goes to help her.
 After many attempts to make Lisa happy, Lisa snaps at Lady Gaga, who then feels that she failed her mission. Lisa soon discovers that her outburst helped her in not bottling up her anger, and runs to find Lady Gaga. When she finds her, Lisa apologizes and Lady Gaga is relieved to find out that her mission was successful.
The two then sing a duet, then Lady Gaga leaves, but not before Moe arrives and asks if she can help him out, but she turns him down.
 Note: In the episode in the tree scene, Lisa wears a watch.
