  When the couch breaks (from the family landing on it in the skydiving couch gag), the family plans to get a new one. Homer orders one from Brooklyn, New York. When the couch arrives, it is discovered that there are bedbugs and soon Springfield is overrun by them.
 Reverend Lovejoy attempts to calm the residents, but then the Parson arrives and brings in Elijah Hooper, who is appointed reverend. The town soon takes a liking to Reverend Hooper and the cultural references that he makes in his sermons.
 Marge is deinfesting her clothes when she finds that her wedding dress has been switched with one from Krusty's skits. When Marge finds Krusty, he explains that he doesn't have Marge's dress anymore. Lisa soon finds it in the hands of another couple who Marge gladly accepts to keep the dress.
 While Homer and Hooper bond, Bart becomes jealous, and he soon sets off with Flanders to find Lovejoy. They find Tim working at a Jacuzzi store, and he doesn't want to go back to his old job as a reverend. Bart and Milhouse find dead insects and lead a herd of frogs into Springfield. The town looks to Hooper, but he is of no help. Tim soon arrives and saves the town by making the frogs fall asleep. The townspeople, including Homer, accept Tim back as the reverend as Willie uses a rake and puts the frogs in a bag, walking away before he meets Lunchlady Doris with a pot with boiling water labeled "Springfield Elementary School".
 Before the episode finishes, a van associated with Oogle drives by the Simpsons' house, where Bart and Homer, who are no longer deacons, moon the members and laugh.
