  Kent Brockman Then, a family drives by Marge as she's about to enter her home. The patriarch of the family offers Marge $300 to spend the night at the Simpson household because there's no place else to go. Marge seems hesitant. Nevertheless, Homer discovers a family in the living room. At first, Homer thinks Marge has remarried after his passing, but then he realizes he's not dead. Marge tells Homer that these are their new boarders. Homer doesn't like the idea of sharing the room other than with Marge. Homer doesn't like the idea of sharing the room other than with Marge. Marge hands him a pamphlet of the Simpsons' Bed and Breakfast and asks Homer, “What would baby Jesus do?” in this situation. Homer automatically thinks of baby Jesus in various business management scenarios before supporting Marge's impulsive scheme.
 While Bart and Homer take to their impromptu hotel management roles, Marge gets increasingly annoyed by the tourist requests and becomes short-tempered towards them. Her Christmas issues find a parallel in Lisa's plan to buy her family gifts that all have more to do with feeling good about herself than buying the presents they will actually like; her choice of a present for Bart, a book, leads him to confront her with this and she admits it is true. She later sells the gift Bart got her and gets him a tablet, preloaded with e-books as well as games/apps. As a thank you, and because she had to sell the gift he initially gave her, Bart gives her the money he made working as a bellboy while housing the tourists, telling Lisa to donate it to whatever cause she wants. Marge is surprised when the tourists seem to be confronting her before leaving but sing a song of Christmas spirit and thanks. While she is touched by the gesture and wishes them safe travels, she remains ill at ease to the end with Christmas music, as she only prefers hearing the first verse of Christmas carols.
