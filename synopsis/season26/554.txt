 Bart repeatedly disrespects Homer's authority. The two then start to fight when Marge insists that they go on a "Relation Ship" to resolve their issues. On the ship, Captain Bowditch reveals Homer and Bart (along with other dads and sons) are on the ship because their families are put off by their constant bickering and reveals his intent to take them out to sea to teach them the importance of having a strong and healthy relationship. Bart excels at sailing and is promoted to mid-shipman while Homer detests it and gets scurvy. After recovering, he drowns his sorrows in a flask containing beer and Captain Bowditch asks him for a drink. It turns out he is a recovering alcoholic. Meanwhile, Marge is left to take care of Homer's fantasy football team ("Somewhere over the Dwayne Bowe"). Since Marge knows nothing about football in general, Lisa educates her, and soon the two lead Homer's team to a championship. A storm is brewing and Captain Bowditch is incapacitated and Bart is the only one who can steer the ship to safety. Homer refuses to accept Bart's new role until he eats a piece of broccoli. After that, Homer begins to have a new found respect for his son, especially when he realizes he has been too harsh on Bart in trying to get him to respect his authority. Homer and Bart are reunited with the rest of the Simpsons.
