 The episode begins when Ned Flanders and his sons are trying to reduce their use of electricity in the house but they discover that Homer is using their electricity to power a Ferris Wheel and a freezer full of meat. When Flanders takes the freezer away (since Homer had "borrowed" it from him), Marge puts the meat to use by making sandwiches. Bart and Lisa take the sandwiches to school, where they replace cigarettes as the schoolyard's currency. Trudy Zangler of Mother Hubbard's Sandwich Cupboard advises Marge to open a franchise with the company. It initially struggles due to its incompetent staff, but begins to make profit when the family take over. However, business slows again when another outlet with the same franchise opens across the road, operated by the Spuckler family. Marge is depressed and goes to Moe's, who tells her a scam to get out of her contract with the franchise. Homer goes into the restaurant in disguise and is attacked in the crotch by Bart, then sues the company rather than the franchise due to conditions in the contract. The episode finishes with a scene showing a caveman Homer making the first ever sandwich from sloth meat between two squirrels, but then he wanders to his death inside a tar pit. In the present, Homer admires the fossilized sandwich.
