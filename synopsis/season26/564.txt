  The family is in the backyard when Elon Musk arrives in his spacecraft, which looks similar to a Dragon Capsule. Elon explains that he came to Springfield because he's looking for a source of inspiration. Homer insists that Elon comes to the power plant. The next day, Elon discovers that Homer is filled with new ideas for inventions. Elon soon meets Mr. Burns and convinces him to build a magnetohydrodynamic generator for the plant. Mr. Burns wants to hire Elon, but he refuses, saying that he doesn't care about the money (much to Mr. Burns' surprise).
 Elon and Mr. Burns explain to the town that the plant has come up with plans for the city's electrical needs. However, Smithers is suspicious about Elon's intentions. Elon also reveals that he created self-driving cars. Bart and Lisa sneak into the family's car and disable the auto-drive mode (using Elon's master password, which is "MUSKRULEZ") and go for a joyride.
 They end up at the plant, where Elon also explains that the town's losing roughly $50 million a quarter, much to Burns' horror. Elon explains that he wants to save the Earth. Burns explains that, thanks to Elon, the plant's facing massive layoffs, and then apologizes to Smithers (he had sicced his hounds on him after he thought that Smithers was spreading false rumors about Elon). Mr. Burns soon plots to kill Elon.
 The next day, Elon is hanging out with Homer when Mr. Burns attempts to assassinate Elon. However, the bullet goes towards Homer's direction. Elon saves Homer, but Homer (under Marge's advice) explains that he and Elon can no longer be friends. Elon is taken to his rocketship, and he leaves to go home, but not before coming back to the Simpson home (he was returning Lisa, who was hiding in his rocket). To make Lisa feel better, Elon gives the family a futuristic birdhouse. Elon then leaves, and remembers the things he misses about Homer, such as his revelation of the dolphin in the Miami Dolphins logo.
