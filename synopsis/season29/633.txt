 After Marge forces everyone to hand in their electronics, the family takes a trip to a book store. There, Bart discovers that he can use the book The Art of War to manipulate Homer into allowing him to go to a Tunnelcraft convention. Homer reads the book to in turn manipulate Bart by behaving like Ned Flanders. Meanwhile, Marge purchases an old book that used to be her favorite in hopes of reading it to Lisa, but realizes that it is culturally offensive. Marge agrees to edit the story in order to lessen the offensive stereotypes and clich√©s, but after she reads it to Lisa, the two agree that it has lost meaning. Lisa chooses to take Marge to Springfield University, where she is told to her relief that modern critics read the book as a subversive satire of conformity. However, Marge is not entirely convinced.
