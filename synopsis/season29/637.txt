  While the Simpsons are eating pork chops, a solar eclipse occurs. Marge, Maggie, Lisa and Bart go outdoors to watch it, but Homer refuses to leave the dining room. Irritated with Homer for not watching the eclipse, Marge wants him to go on a date night the next day.
Flanders was fired from the plant after giving charity money to Mr. Burns. He was soon hired by Springfield Harbor Cruises to be a dance instructor, but his use of the bible as guides to dancing has lead him to become fired. He was then hired by Rolling Stone Magazine, but soon got fired for shaving hair off all members of The Rolling Stones. Afterwards, he attempted to sell bibles with his own Bible stand, but was dwindled by an adjacent Koran stand, leaving him no choice but to become unemployed.
 Flanders eventually got a job at Springfield Elementary as a substitute teacher, after Marge suggested to him to be like Jesus as a teacher. Initially, he felt pressured by all of the disobedient students, particularly with Nelson running the entire plan to ruin Flanders' job. He resigned after Bart spat a spitball onto his mustache, who was peer-pressured by Nelson.
 Homer and Bart went to Moe's to discuss Flanders' ruined life; Homer tells him that Bart was the one who made Flanders' life ruined. Eventually, Bart came up with an idea. He and Homer went to Flanders' house to apologize to Flanders. Bart and Flanders then organized a plan to get the students to be less rowdy. With a few gadgets along the way, he and Flanders were able to make the students calm to Flanders by explaining that it was God's will.
 Near the end of the episode, Flanders is happy to have disciplined the students. He can be a good teacher. The students were quiet but talking to themselves and the class hamster was thinking to himself.
