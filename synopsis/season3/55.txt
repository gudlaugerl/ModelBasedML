  Lurleen wants more from Homer than him being her manager, but Homer cares for his wife and kids and proclaims he made the right choice. He tells her that he can't be the man for her and only wanted to share her talents with the world. Homer explains that he loves Marge and can't think about doing something that could hurt her. Although hurt by this, Lurleen respects his solution to be with his family. Homer offers the man to be her new manager as he rushes home to be with Marge. Once home, he is able to reaffirm his love for her and they have sex.
 On Lurleen's last appearance on Yahoo, a country parody of Hee Haw, she sings a bluesy song and wishes Homer and Marge nothing but the best for them.
