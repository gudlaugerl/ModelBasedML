 God and St. Peter discuss what should allow a soul to enter Heaven. In Springfield Sunday school class, several citizens tell spiritual stories. Ned Flanders remembers how a young door-to-door trampoline salesman once was, until the static discharge of his product almost killed him and a young Homer. He cultivated his characteristic mustache to cover the scar, and converted to Christianity. Marge tells how her atheist great grandmother lived in occupied France during World War II, and with her husband (Moe), she rescued some American paratroopers (Abe, Barney, Carl, Lenny and Sideshow Mel). Lisa tells the story of SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama, founder of Buddhism. God agrees that all righteous souls should be allowed to enter Heaven, including an impacted Mr. Burns (Smithers's plus one).
