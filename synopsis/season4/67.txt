  Homer Bart and Lisa explore the abandoned house and go into the basement. Bart scares Lisa away, but a beautiful girl surprises him, and knocks himself unconscious. When he wakes up, the girl says that her name is Laura Powers, his new neighbor. Meanwhile, Homer watches an advertisement on television about "The Frying Dutchman," an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant run by Captain Horatio McCallister and wants to go.
 Ruth Powers Dolph Kearney Meanwhile, Homer goes to the restaurant with Marge, ignoring the fact that Marge is allergic to fish. Homer orders the all-you-can-eat and literally eats everything (according to one of the staff members, Homer proceeded to eat "all the shrimp and then took some plastic lobsters"), continuing to eat well past closing time and completely taking unfair advantage of the offer. Captain McAllister finally kicks a struggling Homer out after midnight, since even after hours of constant eating he still wasn't full. He goes to trial with his lawyer, Lionel Hutz, claiming false advertising (with help from an entire jury of obese people). In her testimony, Marge is reduced to tears as she recalls how she and Homer drove around for hours afterward looking for another all-you-can-eat fish seafood restaurant before he then went fishing. Homer and the captain make agreements, with Homer now allowed to truly have all he can eat, in exchange for being put on display in the restaurant as "nature's cruelest mistake". Marge, of course, is humiliated. Also, Grampa gets a birthday visit from Bart. After a meeting in the treehouse, Laura tells Bart she is dating Jimbo Jones.
 While Laura and Jimbo kiss, Bart makes a prank call to Moe's Tavern, posing as Jimbo. Moe then comes over and threatens Jimbo with a rusty kitchen knife, causing him to burst into tears, resulting in Laura dumping him. His fate remains unknown afterward. Laura tells Bart that she would date him if he were old enough to grow a mustache. Eventually, Bart and Laura make another prank phone call to Moe's and then laugh.
