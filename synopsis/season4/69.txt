  When Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa unsuccessfully try to get Maggie to speak, Marge tells the family the story of when Lisa said her first word. Bart asks Marge his first word and a flashback is shown: Homer and Marge were in the middle of having sex when a toddler-Bart opens the door causing him to shout "Ay, Caramba!" in surprise. Marge then begins telling the story by describing the spring of 1983 as a time when "Ms. Pac-Man struck a blow for women's rights." It's March of 1983, and the Simpson family (minus Lisa and Maggie) originally lived in an apartment complex on the Lower East Side of Springfield. Homer comes home from work singing "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" when Bart happily runs up to his father shouting "Homer." Homer asks Bart to call him "Daddy" but Bart mischievously calls Homer "Dohmer" causing Homer to get outraged and shout his usual catchphrase "Why you little--!" and strangle Bart.
 One day, after Bart flushes Homer's wallet down the toilet, Marge reveals to them that she is expecting another baby, which leads to Bart imagining a new brother who he can use as a scapegoat for his own horrible behavior, such as writing on the walls, using his tricycle to jump a ramp which happens to lean on the baby, and using the baby to clean up the table when he spills his milk. Marge later points out to Homer that with another baby on the way, they're probably going to need a bigger place. After talking to a real estate agent, who explains that the only houses that Homer and Marge can afford are in a neighborhood known as "The Rat's Nest," they go house hunting while having Marge's older sisters, Patty and Selma, babysit Bart. Homer and Marge try to look for houses, including a houseboat that Captain McAllister has until now. After unsuccessful attempts, the family finds a house on Evergreen Terrace and buy it with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of Grampa's house. Homer promises Grampa he can live with them as thanks for his gesture, only to put him in the retirement home after just a few weeks.
