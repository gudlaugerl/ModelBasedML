  The camera zooms into a cemetery showing numerous tombstones and then the Simpsons home and the Simpsons break the floor and sit on the couch as zombies. Later Bart is seen walking around a room with paintings in light of Rod Serling's Night Gallery and tries to introduce the show, but Marge and Maggie interrupt telling Bart to tell the viewers that the show is scary and might prefer to listen to the old The War of the Worlds broadcast on the radio NPR instead but Bart ignores and they watch the first part.
 The Devil and Daniel Webster Homer Lenny Carl in the form of Ned Flanders Hell Lisa Blue Demon Ironic Punishment Division Lionel Hutz Richard Nixon As the judge prepares to sentence Homer for an eternity of death, Marge shows the jury a photo album showing their wedding day, where Homer's eating of the entire wedding cake sent them to the emergency room. On the back of a photograph, it is revealed that in a statement of love to Marge, Homer pledged his soul to her. This causes the jury to declare Homer's deal with the Devil to be revoked claiming Homer's soul to be the property of Marge. Hutz then returned with a pizza box, believing he lost the case. For when Marge tells him they won, he reveals that the pizza box was all empty. But then, however, despite reluctantly agreeing to give back his soul, the Devil is not willing to let Homer best him and turns Homer's head into a doughnut.
 The next morning, Homer can't stop eating parts of his own head. As he chooses to go to work, Lisa warns him to stay home because standing outside the house are the Springfield Police Department, waiting to rip apart his doughnut-made head and enjoy it with their morning coffee.
 Back in the art gallery, Bart narrates the second spooky story. In a parody of the Twilight Zone episode, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, Bart has a nightmare where the bus crashes and wakes up very paranoid. Bart and Lisa then get on the bus on one rainy morning with Principal Skinner on the bus because his mother hid his car keys to punish him for talking to a woman on the phone. Lisa informs everyone that Bart is acting very paranoid and asks that they act very nice to him, but everyone laughs at him instead. In the middle of the ride, Bart hears tapping on the window, but it is only Groundskeeper Willie, who says that he had to put down his mule and needs a ride. Bart's nightmare then comes true when a gremlin is attacking the bus. Bart keeps trying to warn everyone, but every time Bart looks, the gremlin hides and it even causes Otto to destroy Hans Moleman's AMC Gremlin. Meanwhile In their spaceship high above the Earth, the two aliens Kang and Kodos laugh at the "foolish human" who is very frightened of an imaginary monster, while an identical creature begins attacking their craft.
 Skinner becomes annoyed and closes the window, then forces Bart to sit next to Üter, the German foreign exchange student. Bart eventually gets the emergency flares and throws one at the gremlin, knocking it off the bus, only to be picked up by Ned.
 New Bedlam Insane Asylum Ned ,  Bart In a parody of the Francis Ford Coppola film Bram Stoker's Dracula, the family are watching TV to find out that a vampire has been attacking people with them drained of their blood with two teeth marks on their throat and a black cape was found at the scene. Later, Chief Wiggum assumes that it's the work of a mummy and orders the Egyptian wing of the Springfield museum to be destroyed. This convinces Lisa that vampires are real, though Homer debunks her, despite a report following of Mr. Burns buying the Springfield blood bank. Mr. Burns has blood visible from his mouth which he quickly slurps it up. The Simpsons are then invited to Mr. Burns' mansion for a midnight dinner in Pennsylvania. There it is obvious that Burns is a vampire (with Smithers acting as Renfield). No one believes Lisa, despite her obvious evidence (Burns' unknowingly mentioning over the entrance intercom how the family will be "fresh victims for his ever-growing army of the undead", Burns' shadow moving on its own etc.). Bart and Lisa find Mr. Burns' secret lair while cleaning themselves from spilling "punch" (really blood) on themselves, which can be easily accessed by a staircase. While reading a book about the acts Burns had committed, the vampires in the lair awaken. Bart tries to warn her but is so surprised he can't make full words come out of his mouth and makes her think he's doing Three Stooges impressions. When she does notice the vampires around them, the two try to flee. Bart notices a "Super Fun Happy Slide" lever, and pulls it, turning the stairs into a slide.
 Bart slides right into the clutches of a vampire woman while the rest of undead surround him. He's then presented to Mr. Burns who suddenly arrives transforming from a bat and stands over Bart menacingly before biting him in the neck. Lisa makes it back to her parents and warns them, but they don't believe her when Burns appears, blood on his very visible fangs, with a clearly bitten Bart, who drones in a zombie tone that nothing happened to him. Later that night at the Simpsons home, Bart, now a vampire, visits Lisa's window. He shows her that he's bitten and vamped some of the Springfield kids (Milhouse, Martin, Ralph and Janey), with Lisa being next. He breaks through the window, pins her down and bears his fangs. Just as he's about to bite her, Homer, hearing the noise, bursts into the room stopping him. This quickly reveals to the family that he's a vampire while Bart changes into a bat and flees into the night. Lisa tells her parents that the only way to get Bart back to normal is to kill Mr. Burns. They sneak back into his castle and stake Mr. Burns in his coffin, with Homer succeeding after initially staking Burns in the crotch instead of the heart (but not before Mr. Burns briefly comes back to life and fires Homer).
