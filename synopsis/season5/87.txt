  Marge wins a pair of ballet tickets after donating 30 dollars to a telethon that is trying to raise money for public television. Homer promises to go with her, thinking a ballet is a bear driving in a small car. When Homer learns what a ballet really is, he regrets his decision but can't back out of it. At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer tries to sneak a can of soda out of a vending machine but his arm gets stuck after he grabs onto the can. As he tries to get help, he sticks his hand in another vending machine, getting both arms stuck. He calls Marge to tell her what happened but she doesn't believe him. Ruth Powers drops by to return a power tool, and Marge chooses to take her to the ballet.
 Bart Lisa Lionel Hutz Shotkickers farmer Chief Wiggum Chief Wiggum Ruth drops Marge off at a cafe, but she chooses to stick with friend in her run from the law. Chief Wiggum and Homer catch up with them again. They are cornered by police cars two miles from the state line, but drive off road to a canyon. Homer takes a megaphone and apologizes to Marge and warns her of the canyon, which makes them stop, although Homer and Wiggum drive into it, but are saved by a land fill.
 In a summary at the end, it is revealed that Ruth has the charges dismissed against her (and that her husband was forced by the judge to "pay all back child support"), Lionel was glad to get his money after a hectic night, Marge had to pay several cents for a few antique cans she destroyed (approximately 50 cents, plus an additional $2000 for punitive damages and mental anguish), and Homer was sent to a military camp for more experimental testing (this being a reference to his alleged military testing to get out of Patty and Selma's visit), much to his delight.
