  After being forced to leave the Noiseland Video Arcade, Bart and his best friend, Milhouse, find $20 that Homer lost and order super squishees made entirely out of syrup from Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart. With their senses reeling from the high-sugar content of the drink, they spend the rest of the money on a night out in town. The next morning, Bart wakes up with a hangover and realizes that in the revelry of the night before he joined the Junior Campers, a Boy Scout-style organization that is not affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.

At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking in the woods.
