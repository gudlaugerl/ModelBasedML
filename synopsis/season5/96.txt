  At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, it's time for the "Worker of the Week" award to be given out. Everyone except Homer doesn't care, but he's confident he will win since, according to the plant's union agreement, every employee must win the award at least once, "regardless of incompetence, gross obesity or rank odor." However, Mr. Burns gives the Worker of the Week award to an inanimate carbon rod. Homer is infuriated, and starts to feel dejected that everyone hates him.
 Moe's Tavern Barney Buzz Aldrin Race Banyon Corvair Marge Homer has smuggled potato chips on board, and when he opens the bag they start to float around the cabin. The crew is initially worried they will clog the instruments, but Homer's appetite seems to save the day as he floats after the chips in zero-G, gulping them down to the tune of the Blue Danube. All is going well until Homer flies into an ant farm, destroying it, and letting the ants and chips loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing a song, but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails to put on his "shuttle belt" and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer breaks the hatch handle, dooming the shuttle as it is unable to land. Angered, Homer attacks Buzz with the closest weapon, and inadvertently uses a carbon rod to seal the door shut and they return to Earth.
 Although Buzz Aldrin declares Homer the hero, the press see the inanimate carbon rod as being the bigger hero. The rod is then featured on magazine covers with the headline "In Rod We Trust" and is given its own ticker tape parade. Back at home, Homer is disappointed that he did not get as much respect as he had hoped, but the family still honors him for his achievement.
