  After nearly drowning in his bathtub (due to the weight of a wet sponge upon his head), Mr. Burns realizes that if he had passed away, there would be no one to look over his power plant, so he plans to hold tryouts for local kids to be his heir. Burns rejects Bart in a special way, by using a machine to kick him in the butt. He gets revenge on him by smashing his windows, breaking his statues, and filling his car with water. Mr. Burns notices his evilness and makes Bart his heir.
 Hans Moleman Bart starts to feel lonely and wants to go back to his family. Burns, however, does not want Bart to leave, and shows him a video in an attempt to trick the boy into believing that his family hates him. The family in the video, however, are actually actors. This works, and Bart comes to declare Burns as his true father. The two then celebrate by heading over to the Nuclear Power Plant, where they proceed to fire employees by dropping them down a trapdoor. This goes on until Burns attempts to make Bart fire Homer in an attempt to make him permanently sever his ties with his old family. Bart refuses, and instead attempts to fire Burns, dropping him down the trapdoor instead. Smithers, being the ever-loyal servant that he is, jumps in after Burns.
 With his ties to Burns now severed, Bart moves back in with the other Simpsons, where Marge makes the point that the real Simpson family members truly missed Bart. After a heartfelt reunion, the episode ends with Homer introducing Bart to his "new brother", the still-brainwashed Hans Moleman. 
 As the credits begin to roll, Marge tells Homer that she wants Moleman out of the house.
