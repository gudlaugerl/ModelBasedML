  Homer and Marge attend a candy convention and hire Ashley Grant, a college student, to babysit Bart, Maggie, and Lisa. At the convention, Homer outfits Marge with an over-size trench-coat and is vigilant in smuggling out as much candy as possible in her pockets, to the point she has difficulty even moving until a Gummi Venus de Milo catches his eye. With the use of Marge as a distraction, Homer is able to steal the show's most valuable and rarest candy, the Gummi Venus, using a Buzz Cola and Poprox grenade to escape, possibly injuring many people.
 That night, Homer searches for the Gummi Venus but is unable to find it. Marge reminds him to take Ashley home and Homer grudgingly agrees. While driving back to the college, Ashley misinterprets Homer's frustration of losing the Gummi Venus as sexual anger and tells him to pull over and let her out. When Ashley is getting out Homer's car, he sees the Gummi Venus stuck on the back of her pants and innocently grabs it, and Ashley turns around to see Homer drooling lustily, anticipating finally getting to eat the Gummi Venus. Misinterpreting this poor act for a deliberate sexual advance, Ashley runs off screaming in terror while Homer gleefully eats the candy.
