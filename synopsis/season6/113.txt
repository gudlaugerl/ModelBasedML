 When the marriage of Marge and Homer comes under threat due to their fading sex lives because of things like Homer watching a movie, kids and Homer working long hours. Grampa pieces together a tonic that is guaranteed to help the bad situation. They begin selling it at a mall, and then in Spittle County. They begin visiting multiple towns to cure frigidness and become quite successful. However, while all the parents of Springfield spend more time with each other, the children are banished from the house. Bart and the other kids believe their parents are acting peculiar, under the influence of aliens or the government. They are unaware of Homer and Grampa selling their tonic, so they continue to believe that their parents have turned into reverse vampires: they have to get home before dark, which in the children's view explains the adults' behavior of running inside and closing the blinds as soon as they get home. the farmhouse Homer goes back home and tries to be a better father to his kids, but fails as Lisa states that too much of him is scary. Grampa, for his part, tries to keep selling his tonic (with Barney Gumble standing in for Homer), but it doesn't work. The two of them return to the old farmhouse, each unaware of the other, and both of them manage to accidentally start fires which quickly spread through the house. As the house burns, Grampa and Homer agree of being screwups, and they forgive each other.
