  The Simpsons' pet dog, Santa's Little Helper, seems to be getting a little too frisky for the family's comfort, and all attempts to tire him out fail. Santa's Little Helper runs off with the family in hot pursuit. They follow their pet to the dogtrack and find the hound pursuing a female greyhound racer, named She's the Fastest. The two quickly fall in love and the dog's owner gives her to the family, noting that once a dog falls in love, they lose their "racing spirit".
 Santa's Little Helper and his "girlfriend" share various romantic experiences and one day, to the surprise of the family, she gives birth to 25 puppies. The puppies seem to be very cute and cuddly, but are also very troublesome to the entire family: savaging all of Bart's socks (making him wear Lisa's socks, and culottes to "coordinate"), stealing Homer's snacks, and (apparently) soiling the floor nonstop. Homer and Marge plan to find new homes for the puppies, much to the dismay of Bart and Lisa. They convince Marge to give the puppies one more chance, but at the end of a near-perfect dinner party, the puppies pop out of the turkey, horrifying and disgusting all of the guests.
 The next day, the family prepares to find homes for the puppies. Though several citizens are willing to adopt the puppies, they are unable to do so as the puppies don't like to be separated. Marge wonders how they will find someone who is able to care for 25 puppies whenÂ Mr. Burns arrives and offers to let them live in his mansion. The family question his motives, but as they do so Burns and Smithers steal the dogs (while the family's backs are turned).
 Bart and Lisa manage to track the puppies to Burns' Mansion where they spy on him through a window. He seems to be treating the puppies well, giving them a bath as Bart and Lisa arrive. He even picks a puppy who can stand on his hind legs as his favorite, a feat which somehow reminds him of actor Rory Calhoun, and names him "Little Monty". Just as Bart and Lisa think they might have been wrong about Burns, he walks into the next room and loads a gun, preparing to kill the puppies to make a tuxedo out of them.
