  Radioactive Man Rainier Wolfcastle McBain Springfield Elementary School Kirk Luann Lisa Bart scoffs at this, saying that those 'loser' real heroes aren't winning their fights, and to find heroes that actually accomplish something, you have to turn to action movies. Despite this and encouragement from former child star Mickey Rooney, Milhouse gives up on his acting career. Mickey tried to take over as the new Fallout Boy, but all production on the film is aborted, with the project going bankrupt thanks to price gouging and other unscrupulous conduct by the people of Springfield (i.e. Mayor Quimby inventing new taxes on the fly to take every red cent they have). Due to the town's misbehavior, the film would never come into fruition. Mickey scolds them for doing this. However, Mayor Quimby and the others refuse to give the money back. The directors then return to Hollywood, "where people treat each other right."
