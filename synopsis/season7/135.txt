  Mr. Burns organizes an exercise program at the power plant. Though many of the workers are impressed by this program as it keeps them fit and motivated, Homer hates it. After learning that those on disability get to work at home (and not take part in the exercises), he tries to injure himself. When he discovers that hyper-obesity counts as a disability, he chooses to put on weight until he is 300 pounds. In this way, he can be legally disabled and force Burns to let him telecommute. Despite Marge's protests that this could endanger his health and jeopardize her attraction to him, Homer engages in nearly unprecedented gluttony. After a mass eating spree with Bart, he tells Homer that they're out of food, including the basics. Faced with the prospect of another day at work, Homer eats a Play-Doh donut that Maggie made. This manages to push him over the 300 pound goal due to the Play-Doh being non-toxic (much to his excitement), but Bart notices that Homer's gut is caught on the towel bar. Once Homer lets his gut hang down, the scale readjusts to 315 pounds, much to his amazement.
