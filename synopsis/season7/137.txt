  Krusty the Clown begins another episode of his show, but on a serious note; he thanks the children for their contributions to a food drive. However, the cans and boxes of food that were sent in by fans of the show are not being used to feed needy families, but as part of a super-sloppy obstacle course competition (a la Double Dare). Bart and Lisa, as usual, revel in the mayhem and Krusty's abuse of Sideshow Mel.
 At the same time, the prisoners at the Springwood Minimum Security Prison are also laughing at the mayhem as well, causing Sideshow Bob to lose his concentration while building a model of Westminster Abbey inside a bottle and ruin his project.

At the same time, Bob, impersonating an Air Force colonel, gains access into the restricted area of a hangar, where he finds a 10-megaton nuclear weapon.
 Col. Hapablap Springfield Squeaky Voiced Teen Later, while national guardsmen frantically search the base for Sideshow Bob, Mayor Quimby and Col. Hapablap meet each other and they both decide what to do. When Bob is nowhere to be found, Quimby (who is out of options and is running out of time) decides to give in to Bob's ultimatum, despite Krusty's (self-interest motivated) insistence that in a world without television, "the survivors would envy the dead!". As a result, television transmitters are destroyed, television stations hastily plan farewell programs, and Kent Brockman gives a farewell speech, toasting all of the good times that he shared with viewers, such as premium ice cream price wars.
 As Bob (whom, we learn, was televising his demands from a stolen Duff Blimp) gleefully celebrates the success of his plan (but also rues the fact that he didn't make more demands, including one for some "decent local marmalade"), Krusty is determined not to give in to his former co-star's demands (if he can stay on the air, he'd have 100% of the audience), so he takes refuge in a civil defense shed and heavily improvises a show including The Stingy and Battery Show after turning on the transmitter. Bob finds out about this and is outraged; later resignedly remarking that it ultimately was a failure as Krusty's slapdash show could "have come from the laziest Hollywood hack".
 Duff Blimp Bob, outraged that the nuclear bomb didn't destroy Springfield, takes Bart hostage and puts a knife against his neck after landing the blimp. However, Lisa manages to sneak away and creates a message announcing Bob's whereabouts. When Chief Wiggum tries to arrest Bob, the convict just laughs and takes Bart to a hangar, where he attempts to steal a Harrier jet (which the Air Force intended to use for a war the next day), but ends up crashing it into a ditch shortly after the starting point, to which Bob then steals the original Wright Brothers aircraft (which had been an exhibit at the air show), making the commanding officer upset as "the Smithsonian's going to hand [the Colonel's] ass on a platter" as a result. Just then, two Air Force F-14s take off to intercept Bob. However, they overshoot the Wright Brothers' plane and the pilots suggest they get out and walk.
 However, all is not well yet. Just as Bob is taken into custody, an Air Force operative accidentally drives a tank over the Wright Brothers plane, crushing it to bits (which is perhaps to be expected, as tanks aren't usually driven in the Air Force). After Bob gets hauled away back to jail, Grampa appears on his motorcycle, who tells everyone that he is going to "haul ass to Lollapalooza". This makes the Simpsons exclaim, "Here we go again" while Marge says it un-enthusiastically.
