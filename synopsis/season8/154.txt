  In the kitchen, Homer lights up a Jack-O-Lantern, but ends up lighting his arm on fire. He runs off and on the screen screaming while the title is shown. The couch gag depicts a grim reaper sitting on the couch, and the family suddenly falls and dies instantly in front of him. The grim reaper then relaxes and places his feet on the pile of Simpsons corpses.
