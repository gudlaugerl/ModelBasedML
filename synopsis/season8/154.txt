 The Hunchback of Notre Dame Basket Case Maggie Marge Dr. Hibbert Hugo In a parody of the Twilight Zone episode, The Little People, Lisa places a tooth in cola for a school science project. After being shocked by static electricity from Bart, Lisa touches the tooth, and the spark causes life to evolve in the petrify dish where the cola and tooth are. In less than a few days, the tiny people have evolved to a futuristic city-scape. However, Bart playfully destroys some of their tiny buildings, causing them to launch a counterattack, sending a small fleet of aerial vehicles to attack him. Bart wants to destroy them for attacking him, but Lisa intervenes. He leaves, threatening that he will get revenge on them. Shortly after this, a strange beam from the petri dish hits Lisa, shrinking her down and into the tooth city, where she finds she is hailed as a god and Bart as the devil. The citizenry ask her for many answers, to which she promises she can help if she were big again. However, the people have not figured the technology to enlarge objects. Matters become worse when Bart claims the petri dish and the civilization as his own, winning the school science fair. Realizing that she is trapped with the tooth city's inhabitants forever, Lisa settles in to become their leader, beginning by ordering them to bring her some nice shoes to replace her now gone slippers, and some socks, too (as one inhabitant suggests).
