 One sunny morning, Mr. Smithers is walking to work when a mysterious black car pulls up and a woman offers him a job. Smithers refuses, but later because of his time with the plant, Homer is approached by the same woman to which he accepts the job at Globex Corporation and the family agrees to move to Cypress Creek . Homer meets his new boss, Hank Scorpio and takes to him really well, and it soon becomes apparent that he has a do-nothing job completely suited to his skills. Unfortunately, the rest of the family isn't enjoying their new surroundings. Marge finds her new house requires a fraction of the maintenance of their old dump, and is hopelessly bored. Bart gets put in the remedial class at school with some really messed up kids, and Lisa is allergic to all of the plants in the area. Back at the workplace, Homer is oblivious that his boss is in fact an evil genius bent on world domination. But Homer enjoys his work. It's the best job he has ever taken, and Hank Scorpio honestly shows an interest in Homer's hopes and dreams. However, family tells him that they want to move back to Springfield . Stuck with a difficult choice, Homer plans to visit Scorpio at his office. Homer arrives in the middle of an assault by government forces on Hank's fortress, similar to the James Bond film You Only Live Twice . When Homer explains his dilemma to him, Hank advises Homer to do what he feels is best for his family, and Homer reluctantly decides to resign. He slowly walks out in the middle of a raging battle. When the Simpsons return to Springfield, a newspaper on their doorstep says that Hank Scorpio has seized the East Coast. Homer then picks up a letter saying that Hank Scorpio has given him a farewell gift. "It's not the Dallas Cowboys but it's a start." Homer had admitted that his lifelong dream was to own the Cowboys, and Scorpio gives him the Denver Broncos . Homer is vaguely disappointed as he watches the rather inept team practicing on the front lawn.
