  The SimpsonsÂ take a trip to an apple cider mill, where they meet Ned Flanders. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns arrives on his his train back home from a college football game. The train is stopped for a few minutes due to a couch being shoved on the tracks. A few yards away from the train, a souvenir stand operator, Larry, sees a perfect opportunity to sell some stuff, until he sees Burns on the train, pulls a locket out of his jacket, compares the picture in the frame to Burns, and stands there in shock at the realization. He hitches a ride to Springfield from Homer and the family who are driving back from the cider mill. They drop him off at Burns's mansion, where he meets Mr. Burns. At first Burns is irritated at him for ringing his door bell after hours, but his irritation turns to shock when he learns that the man is his estranged son, Larry Burns.
 After checking his scalp for the family birthmark, Mr. Burns discovers Larry is, in fact, his biological son. He tells the story of his conception in which he had an affair with Larry's biological mother, Lily Bancroft, at a Yale reunion. Burns then proceeds to tell Larry that unfortunately his mother had tragically passed away years before. The two then attempt to put together the foundation of a constructive relationship. Burns takes him to a gala which he immediately regrets as the formality of the event clashes with Larry's casual demeanor. As a result he unintentionally insults the people with jokes and embarrasses Burns. To keep Larry out of his hair, he gives him a job at the plant, where he and Homer become fast friends. Larry invites Homer over for dinner. During dinner, Burns becomes fed up with Larry and starts to hate him as a son. Homer suggests they plan a fake kidnapping, which they go through with. When Burns hears of the kidnapping, he is in fact outraged because he felt like someone was stealing from him by kidnapping his son.
