  Leonard Nimoy begins the episode hosting a show about alien encounters. He begins talking about an encounter in a town called Springfield.
 At Moe's on Friday night, Homer drinks over ten bottles of "Red Tick Beer", a brand that is brewed with real dogs swimming in the brewing tanks. He takes a breathalyzer test which declares he is as drunk as Boris Yeltsin, and he chooses to walk home. However, Homer takes the wrong path and gets lost and disoriented in the woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing thin-boned alien. Although the alien says, "Don't be afraid," Homer panics and runs through a corn field spelling out the word "Yahhh!"
