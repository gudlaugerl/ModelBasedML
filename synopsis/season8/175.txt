  Reverend Lovejoy's service on "constancy" nearly sends the entire congregation to sleep. After church, Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield Dump to dispose of their old Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent, understood as Mr. Sparkle. The face on the box of detergent shows a remarkable resemblance to Homer, while the Japanese writing on the box says it will banish food particles to the land of wind and ghosts.
 Marge Reverend Lovejoy Church Homer, disturbed by the box of Mr. Sparkle, contacts the manufacturer on the Japanese island of Hokkaido for information. He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle, which only contains a bizarre Japanese cliche TV commercial. At the end of the video however, the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, a fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle; thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.
 Ned Flanders Jimbo Kearney Leftorium The next morning, a distraught Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing. It then cuts to Ned, worse for wear, running for his life as the bullies are pursuing him on their motorbikes with the clear intent of beating him to a pulp. Marge soon realizes she may be partially responsible for his disappearance. Marge goes to Reverend Lovejoy for help, and the two of them track Ned to the zoo. With Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney already having abandoned their pursuit, Ned now finds himself trapped in the baboon exhibit. While the Simpson family watches from afar, Reverend Lovejoy rescues Ned on the baboon's food train, defeating several of the animals while doing so. Now that he feels useful again, Reverend Lovejoy rediscovers his passion for his job, regaling his congregation, who are hanging on to his every word while he recounts the tale of Ned's rescue.
