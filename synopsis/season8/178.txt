  Springfield Police Station Homer Marge Chief Wiggum Rommelwood Military School Disneyland Lisa The pair get a hard time from the other cadets: Bart starts to fit in after a while, the others calling him a "natural solider," while Lisa, the first female ever to join the academy, remains an outcast despite enduring the same hazing as her brother. Bart tries to keep her spirits up, while keeping the fact that he cares about her a secret from the others.
 At the end of the term, a final challenge awaits all the students; they must pass a physical test called "The Eliminator." In the Commandant's own words, it is a "150 foot hand-over-hand crawl across a 60 gauge Hemp-Jute line with a blister factor of 12. The rope is suspended a full 40 feet over a solid British acre of Old Growth Connecticut Valley Thorn Bushes." Bart helps Lisa to train in secret. The others cheer when she nearly falls off, and Bart starts calling out helpful thing such as "Come on, you can do it!" and "I believe in you, Lisa!" He gets hand gagged by another cadet but gets him off and continues to chant helpful things which help Lisa. They pass, and Lisa receives a medal for "Satisfactory Completion of the Second Grade."
 Homer and Marge pick up Bart and Lisa from school, and agree to take them to Disneyland for real, but it turns out they have been tricked again, as they are being taken to a dentist â€” much to Bart and Lisa's dismay and Marge and Homer's amusement.
