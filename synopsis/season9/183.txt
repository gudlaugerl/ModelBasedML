  The Simpsons attend a soccer match between Mexico and Portugal. When the game starts, the crowd begins to lose interest and it turns into a violent soccer riot. Groundskeeper Willie with his three fellow Scotsmen find the riot still too peaceful to their liking and decide to "take 'em to school", which makes the riot escalate. Eventually, it spreads all over Springfield, forcing mob rule to be installed. Homer does not want to pay $500 for a Home Security System and plans to buy a firearm. After the gruelling five day waiting period, Homer surprises Marge with his new revolver. She is horrified and appalled, demanding that he get rid of the gun. Homer persuades Marge to come with him to the local National Rifle Association ("Come in and shoot your mouth off.") meeting to try and get her to change her mind, but after the meeting, she remains unconvinced.

 Homer and Marge make up, after Homer explains he has finally gotten rid of the gun. While leaving, Snake arrives to rob the desk clerk, demanding the cash register's contents while holding a knife to Mayor Quimby's throat. Homer pulls out his gun saying ("Freeze, bad guy!") and foils the robbery causing Quimby to run off. Marge is angry at Homer for lying to her again, but whilst he's apologizing to her, Snake snatches the gun. Homer, however, reveals that there are no bullets in the gun. Snake responds by pointing the empty gun at Homer and he surrenders the bullets. Some of the other NRA members arrive and stop Snake from shooting Homer, but he gets away with the money all the same. Homer apologizes to Marge and explains that the weapon makes him feel powerful and cool. He gives Marge the gun and begs her to get rid of it for him.
