  Krusty the Clown's show is coming under criticism by the FCC for not providing enough educational material for children, so Channel 6 agree to put a mini-series in to avoid further trouble. They choose to make it a children's news program and the producers look toward Springfield Elementary for staff. Meanwhile, Groundskeeper Willie takes away Bart's skateboard for messing up the leaves he just raked and as revenge, Bart fills Willie's shack with creamed corn, destroying it, and leaving Willie homeless. Bart then obtains his skateboard. Lisa is chosen for head anchor and has to pick the rest of the staff. Marge forces her to make Bart part of the show. During the first show, Bart upstages Lisa with his over-the-top Sports report. Lindsey Naegle observes this and makes him co-anchor.
 Meanwhile, Homer goes to the Kwik-E-Mart to see that while Apu is healing from multiple wounds, he has a helper monkey to run the store. Homer is perplexed by the idea and goes to buy one himself, calling it Mojo. However, the monkey becomes as big of a slob as Homer is and Homer has to give him back to the store when Mojo becomes overweight from overeating and lack of exercise.
 Bart overhears a conversation between Lisa and the producer where he hears her call him "dumb". To prove her wrong, he goes to Kent Brockman for advice for help with his report. Kent shows him some of his emotional stories, inspiring Bart to create his own segment, "Bart's People", on the next show. Everyone who watches is touched, but Lisa sees through Bart and realizes the words he says are disjointed, so Lisa tracks down and tells Willie about a poor immigrant taking refuge in the dump. When Bart does his live report Willie comes out of nowhere, but Lisa comes to save Bart. They see that their disagreement will get them nowhere and the plan to retool the show to make it better, but it gets cancelled and replaced with "The Mattel and Mars Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour" much to Lisa's dismay.
